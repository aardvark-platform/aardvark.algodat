LASzip.Net
==========

The LASzip LiDAR compressor packaged as a simple stand-alone assembly for
easy inclusion of compression and decompression functionality into
other software. It compresses LAS files into much more compact LAZ
files and vice versa. The resulting files are around 7 - 20 percent
of their original size.

To get the original LASzip just download the LAStools distribution which contains
the LASlib as well as the LASzip sources together with the binaries
of the popular LAStools software and some small example LAZ files.

To get the newest version of the C# port of the LASzip library, goto:
https://github.com/shintadono/laszip.net

ATTENTION: This port is not a complete port of the LASzip library. It does not
contain the example provided in it (but has some examples off it's own), and
you can't create version 1 and 3 LAZ files, while reading version 1 and 3 is
still possible.
